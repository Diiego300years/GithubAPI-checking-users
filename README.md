# GithubAPI-checking-users
Hi,
it's API which can check users on github. You can check how many repositories someone have, how many people someone colaborated and what's the size of this repo  :)
You can find all in main.py, other files are very similar and nothing special.


**I left this project here because you can nicely see how I've grow up from this program to business_card project   :)**

Check it out guys!
